## About v2

Muximux v2 was a lightweight PHP portal for managing webapps in a tabbed interface. It required a PHP-enabled web server (nginx, Apache, IIS).

Your existing v2 installation will continue to work, but no further updates will be released for this version.

## Upgrading to v3

Visit the [main branch](../../tree/main) for v3 installation instructions and releases.
